# MiddleGround

[middle-ground.herokuapp.com](http://middle-ground.herokuapp.com/)

The idea for MiddleGround is simple: find the midpoint between two people and give them a place to go. With MiddleGround, select a friend and an activity, and the app will find an appropriate matching location halfway between you and your friend. This way, the hard part is done, and you can focus on spending time with the people you care about.
